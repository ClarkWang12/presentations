This is the new hub for my presentations and themes.

# Usage

Besides a somewhat up-to-date LaTeX installation, you can make most of these presentations by using presentation software that supports presenter notes. Each presentation comes in three files:
* -slides: This version contains the slides that are normally only visible to the audience
* -notes: This version contains only the notes, and are only for the presenter. Each slide has its own page of notes
* -both: Contains both the slides and notes, side by side

I used to use [SplitShow](https://code.google.com/p/splitshow/), but it doesn't support hyperlinks made by hyperref. So now I use [Skim](http://skim-app.sourceforge.net). The downside is that Skim wants to have separate versions of the slides and notes. SplitShow did fine with the both version.
